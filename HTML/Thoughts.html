      <p>Today is Friday. Friday is one of those wrap up days of the week where many feel either anxious to complete something or excited for the advent of the relaxing weekend. 
        Whatever it may be, friday will continue to hold special value in the week. The weather is trying to cool down in Texas, which is nice for those who enjoy the chills. I've discussed with a friend recenetly about a therapy in experimental phase to expand life expectancy. The concept of time in regard to death and life is such an interesting concept to inspect. A lot of the idea has to do with fulfillment. I found an interesting quote from the rapper Macklemore in one of his songs detailing the uncertainty of life in a specifc context of a drug abuser. In the song, "Otherside", Macklemore sings, "We live on the cusp of death hoping that it won't be us." As living beings death is such a grieved and despised event in most of it's attributes. That is why I believe the expansion of life expectancy through therapy to reduce the shortening of telomere's which comprise DNA will only become more researched throughout a millenial's future lifetime. We can only hope that this technology is not used in the wrong way.

      <p> Hello to all whom may come across this. This past week the weather has continue to cool, even reaching ~40 degrees in College Station, Texas.
        This weather is absolutely phenomenal - for those who enjoy being chilly. The weekend is a nice time to stop and reflect on the week. Additionally,
        one may be rejuvenated by the break from regular routines. There are many dimensions leveled into one human's overall health, and the weekend is a valuable asset to those dimensions. I've been thinking a lot about some things that I heard from a famous female runner, Des Linden. If you've never heard of her, I'd recommend checking out a short clip of her finishing the Boston marathon in adverse weather conditions. She has a lot of interesting insights, but I'll link a quote that helps me be reassured in difficulty.</p></center>

        <center><p>"Stepping outside the comfort zone is the price I pay to find out how good I can be. If I planned on backing off every time running got difficult I would hang up my shoes and take up knitting." - Des Linden</p></center>

      <left><p>I don't think Des Linden is hating on knitting here. She is just saying she will sacrifice comfort and welcome pain in order to better herself. There are places of pain in life where people often compartmentalize or set aside the issue in the instant. The places in life one is willing to sacrifice the most is revealing of that persons values. Where will we be tomorrow when we decide to confront and defeat the deterring factors - pain, comfort, or fear.</p></left>

      <p> On second note, this will most likely not be a weekly tradition due to the fact that I am inconsistently motivated and am
      struggling with coursework this semester. With respect to the weather update, I am pretty convinced that this has been the coolest day
      College Station, Texas has seen since January / February. This weekend is my eldest sister's birthday, so I will enjoy taking a break from
      school with tasty treats to be consumed and pleasant memories to made as we celebrate the continuity of her life from the past year. I heard 
        someone reference this quote this week, which was very inspiring.</p></left>

      <center><p>"The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit." - Nelson Henderson</p></center>
      
    <left><p>The emphasis of this quote could not be more important in the post-modern culture that society follows today. I've had interesting talks with 
      people about the concept of altruism, some believe that no true altruism exists, others believe it's integral to their lives and idealogies. 
      Regardless of your beliefs about true altruism, one must realize that where you are today is strongly correlated to sacrifice of others. People must
      help people, otherwise society fails. Nobody can survive alone, and that is become more evident through the social problems arising today. So just
      consider helping someone today, and don't expect any benefit for yourself. Consider planting a tree that you will not reap future benefit from, because
      this world needs your help desperately. I often struggle in serving others, because I have this expectation that somehow my help must be repayed with some
      benefit. Whether it be a favor down the road, free food or gifts at a serving event, or something else. However, this notion is flawed, because if most people
      that can't sustain themselves in certain scenarios will most likely not be able to repay you in the way you are expecting. That's why we need to push our
      limits to perform acts of unconditional service, where we will not be receiving any form of compensation, and that includes satisfaction from knowing the outcome
      and results of some efforts in the situation. Have a wonderful weekend.

          <p> A week has passed from the last blog - so maybe this will be a weekly tradition. This past week has been relatively okay, 
      with some sadness for poor grades being attained. However, I do feel that this semester is providing me with a greater 
      understanding of who I am, how I have come to know the world, and where I want to be going - which I am ever so grateful 
      for in during this hectic time where many are distraught and unassured for the future. I got to catch up with an old friend via text message, 
      and he was helpful by giving me some advice for polishing my resume. I'm grateful for friends who go the extra mile to help others, 
      in fact they are my role models and mentors. This past week also entailed a trip to one of my favorite restaurant's, Chuy's, where me 
      and two friends I met intro to chemistry class enjoyed delicious Tex-Mex. In all of this coming week's challenges, know that you are going somewhere great. 
      Envision the week as a stepping stone to the weekend, which can be envisioned as a bigger stepping stone for the year. 
      The stone's may not be perfect in shape, but they function for a greater purpose.</p></left>

          <p> Today the morning weather was pretty nice and the clouds were beautifully drifting across the dimly lit sky. 
      Being able to catch up with a friend from Freshman year while doing some exercise was both exciting and tiring. 
      The act of seeing a friend whom you have not caught up with in a while is always encouraging. Everyone has their unique struggles, 
      but when two can share those struggles with each other comfotably - something special happens. My friend encapsulates this attribute. 
      I just wanted to quote something that I found very encouraging, which was, "You are more than just a sum of your parts." 
      This quote was cool to hear, because I often think people feel trapped or restrained in ceratin situations or hardships. 
      However, being more than just a sum of those parts speaks to show that although life is challenging, 
      people have so much more to offer to others and themselves than they could ever imagine. Have a nice day.</p></left>
