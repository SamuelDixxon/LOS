          <p>Today the morning weather was pretty nice and the clouds were beautifully drifting across the dimly lit sky. Being able to catch up with a friend from Freshman year while doing some exercise was both exciting and tiring. The act of seeing a friend whom you have not caught up with in a while is always encouraging. Everyone has their unique struggles, but when two can share those struggles with each other comfotably - something special happens. My friend encapsulates this attribute. I just wanted to quote something that I found very encouraging, which was, "You are more than just a sum of your parts." This quote was cool to here, because I often think people feel trapped or restrained in ceratin situations or hardships. However, being more than just a sum of those parts speaks to show that although life is challenging, people have so much more to offer to others and themselves than they could ever imagine. Have a nice day.</p></left>
