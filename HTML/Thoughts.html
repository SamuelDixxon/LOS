          <p>A week has passed from the last blog - so maybe this will be a weekly tradition. This past week has been relatively okay, with some sadness for poor grades being attained. However, I do feel that this semester is providing me with a greater understanding of who I am, how I have come to know the world, and where I want to be going - which I am ever so grateful for in during this hectic time where many are distraught and unassured for the future. I got to catch up with an old friend via text message, and he was helpful by giving me some advice for polishing my resume. I'm grateful for friends who go the extra mile to help others, in fact they are my role models and mentors. This past week also entailed a trip to one of my favorite restaurant's, Chuy's, where me and two friends I met intro to chemistry class enjoyed delicious Tex-Mex. In all of this coming week's challenges, know that you are going somewhere great. Envision the week as a stepping stone to the weekend, which can be envisioned as a bigger stepping stone for the year. The stone's may not be perfect in shape, but they function for a greater purpose.</p></left>

          <p>Today the morning weather was pretty nice and the clouds were beautifully drifting across the dimly lit sky. Being able to catch up with a friend from Freshman year while doing some exercise was both exciting and tiring. The act of seeing a friend whom you have not caught up with in a while is always encouraging. Everyone has their unique struggles, but when two can share those struggles with each other comfotably - something special happens. My friend encapsulates this attribute. I just wanted to quote something that I found very encouraging, which was, "You are more than just a sum of your parts." This quote was cool to hear, because I often think people feel trapped or restrained in ceratin situations or hardships. However, being more than just a sum of those parts speaks to show that although life is challenging, people have so much more to offer to others and themselves than they could ever imagine. Have a nice day.</p></left>
