			/tOn second note, this will most likely not be a weekly tradition due to the fact that I am inconsistently motivated and am
			struggling with coursework this semester. With respect to the weather update, I am pretty convinced that this has been the coolest day
			College Station, Texas has seen since January / February. This weekend is my eldest sister's birthday, so I will enjoy taking a break from
			school with tasty treats to be consumed and pleasant memories to made as we celebrate the continuity of her life from the past year. I heard 
			someone reference this quote this week, which was very inspiring. 
			
			"The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit." - Nelson Henderson
			
			The emphasis of this quote could not be more important in the post-modern culture that society follows today. I've had interesting talks with 
			people about the concept of altruism, some believe that no true altruism exists, others believe it's integral to their lives and idealogies. 
			Regardless of your beliefs about true altruism, one must realize that where you are today is strongly correlated to sacrifice of others. People must
			help people, otherwise society fails. Nobody can survive alone, and that is become more evident through the social problems arising today. So just
			consider helping someone today, and don't expect any benefit for yourself. Consider planting a tree that you will not reap future benefit from, because
			this world needs your help desperately. I often struggle in serving others, because I have this expectation that somehow my help must be repayed with some
			benefit. Whether it be a favor down the road, free food or gifts at a serving event, or something else. However, this notion is flawed, because if most people
			that can't sustain themselves in certain scenarios will most likely not be able to repay you in the way you are expecting. That's why we need to push our
			limits to perform acts of unconditional service, where we will not be receiving any form of compensation, and that includes satisfaction from knowing the outcome
			and results of your efforts in the situation. Have a wonderful weekend.

          <p>/tA week has passed from the last blog - so maybe this will be a weekly tradition. This past week has been relatively okay, 
		  with some sadness for poor grades being attained. However, I do feel that this semester is providing me with a greater 
		  understanding of who I am, how I have come to know the world, and where I want to be going - which I am ever so grateful 
		  for in during this hectic time where many are distraught and unassured for the future. I got to catch up with an old friend via text message, 
		  and he was helpful by giving me some advice for polishing my resume. I'm grateful for friends who go the extra mile to help others, 
		  in fact they are my role models and mentors. This past week also entailed a trip to one of my favorite restaurant's, Chuy's, where me 
		  and two friends I met intro to chemistry class enjoyed delicious Tex-Mex. In all of this coming week's challenges, know that you are going somewhere great. 
		  Envision the week as a stepping stone to the weekend, which can be envisioned as a bigger stepping stone for the year. 
		  The stone's may not be perfect in shape, but they function for a greater purpose.</p></left>

          <p>/tToday the morning weather was pretty nice and the clouds were beautifully drifting across the dimly lit sky. 
		  Being able to catch up with a friend from Freshman year while doing some exercise was both exciting and tiring. 
		  The act of seeing a friend whom you have not caught up with in a while is always encouraging. Everyone has their unique struggles, 
		  but when two can share those struggles with each other comfotably - something special happens. My friend encapsulates this attribute. 
		  I just wanted to quote something that I found very encouraging, which was, "You are more than just a sum of your parts." 
		  This quote was cool to hear, because I often think people feel trapped or restrained in ceratin situations or hardships. 
		  However, being more than just a sum of those parts speaks to show that although life is challenging, 
		  people have so much more to offer to others and themselves than they could ever imagine. Have a nice day.</p></left>
